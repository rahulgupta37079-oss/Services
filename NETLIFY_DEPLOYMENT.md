## 🎨 Before You Deploy (Optional Customization)

### Update Your Information

| Email | `info@passion3dworld.com` | Your email |
| Hours | `9:00 AM - 12:00 PM` | Your hours |
| Address | `Your City, Your State` | Your location |

### Set Up Contact Forms (Important!)

1. **Go to**: https://formspree.io
2. **Sign up** for free (3 forms free)
3. **Create a form** and get your form ID
4. **Update** `index.html`:
   - Find: `action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"`
   - Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID
   - Do this for BOTH forms (quote form and contact form)

## 📋 What Works Out of the Box

✅ **Responsive Design** - Perfect on all devices  
✅ **Pricing Calculator** - Interactive, real-time  
✅ **File Upload UI** - Visual feedback, validation  
✅ **All Sections** - Services, materials, portfolio, etc.  
✅ **Navigation** - Smooth scrolling

## 🔧 What Needs Setup (After Deploy)

⚠️ **Contact Forms**:
- Forms need Formspree setup
- Without it, forms won't send emails
- Free plan: 50 submissions/month
- Takes 2 minutes to set up

📤 **File Upload**:
- Visual upload works
- Actual file sending needs form backend
- Customers can still email files to you

---

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment, you can add your own domain:

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to: Site settings → Domain management
   - Click: Add custom domain
   - Enter: `passion3dworld.com` (your domain)

2. **Update DNS**:
   - Follow Netlify's instructions
   - Add CNAME or A records
   - Wait 24-48 hours for propagation

3. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Netlify adds HTTPS automatically
   - Free, included with all sites
