## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What Works on Netlify:
✅ All 4 calculator pages  
✅ Navigation and routing  
✅ Real-time price calculations  
✅ File upload interface  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Static asset serving  

### What Needs Configuration on Netlify:
⚠️ **Backend API routes** - Won't work (Netlify Functions needed)  
⚠️ **Database** - No D1 support (use external DB)  
⚠️ **Form submissions** - Need Netlify Forms or Formspree  

### Recommended for Full Features:
The application is already deployed on **Cloudflare Pages** with full functionality:
- **Production URL**: https://passion3d-world.pages.dev
- Backend API routes working
- Database integration ready
- Best performance

## 📧 Setting Up Forms on Netlify

The forms currently use API routes. To make them work on Netlify:

### Option A: Use Netlify Forms

Update form tags in the HTML:

```html
<form name="quote" method="POST" data-netlify="true" netlify-honeypot="bot-field">
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="quote" />
  <!-- Add your form fields -->
</form>
```

Then forms will appear in: Netlify Dashboard → Forms

### Option B: Use Formspree

1. Sign up at https://formspree.io
2. Create form endpoints
3. Update form `action` attributes to Formspree URLs

---

## 🌐 Custom Domain on Netlify

### Add Your Domain:

1. **Go to**: Site settings → Domain management
2. **Click**: "Add custom domain"
3. **Enter**: `yourdomain.com`
4. **Follow**: DNS configuration instructions
5. **Wait**: For DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
6. **SSL**: Automatically provisioned by Netlify

### DNS Settings:

**For Apex Domain** (yourdomain.com):
```
A Record: 75.2.60.5
```

**For Subdomain** (www.yourdomain.com):
```
CNAME Record: your-site-name.netlify.app
```
