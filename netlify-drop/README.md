## 🎯 Recommended Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Cloudflare Pages (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

**Why Cloudflare Pages?**
- ✅ Best performance (edge deployment)
- ✅ Database support (D1 SQLite)
- ✅ Serverless functions (Hono backend)
- ✅ Free tier with generous limits
- ✅ Already configured and working

**Current Production Deployment:**
- **Main URL**: https://passion3d-world.pages.dev
- **Latest**: https://3e253b24.passion3d-world.pages.dev

**To Deploy:**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build the project
npm run build

# 3. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
npm run deploy
```

---

### Method 2: Netlify via GitHub

**Connect GitHub Repository to Netlify:**

1. **Go to Netlify**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Click**: "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. **Choose**: GitHub
4. **Select Repository**: `rahulgupta37079-oss/Services`
5. **Build Settings**:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
6. **Deploy!**

**Build Configuration** (`netlify.toml` needed):
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

⚠️ **Limitations on Netlify:**
- Backend API routes won't work (Hono requires Workers/Functions)
- Database features won't work (no D1 support)
- Forms need Formspree or Netlify Forms integration

---

### Method 3: Netlify Drop (Static Only - Limited)

**For Homepage Only:**

The current `index.html` in this directory is the homepage only. To use:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag `index.html` into the drop zone
3. Get instant URL: `https://random-name.netlify.app`

⚠️ **This method only deploys the homepage** - calculator pages won't work.

## 📧 Setting Up Forms on Netlify

If you deploy to Netlify, forms need to be reconfigured:

### Option A: Netlify Forms (Built-in)

Add `netlify` attribute to forms:

```html
<form name="quote" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="quote" />
  <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

### Option B: Formspree (External)

1. Sign up: https://formspree.io
2. Create form endpoints
3. Update form actions in code

---

## 🌐 Custom Domain

### On Cloudflare Pages:
```bash
npx wrangler pages domain add yourdomain.com --project-name passion3d-world
```

### On Netlify:
1. Site settings → Domain management
2. Add custom domain
3. Follow DNS instructions
4. SSL auto-configured
